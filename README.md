# Name that Song (Lyrics Game)

Name that Song is a lyrics game made with a plain JavaScript, custom CSS, and HTML frontend and a Rails backend API.

Users can enter a username to start playing. Random lyrics from the database are selected for each game. Users must match the song title to the lyrics to receive a point. When logged in, a user's high score is displayed and updates when a new high score is achieved.
